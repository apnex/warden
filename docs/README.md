## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### engine/warden.js
- **Features:** `Self-Healing`, `Safe Protocol Lookup`, `Session Logging (exec)`

### engine/lib/handlers.js
- **Handlers:** `file_freshness`, `file_exists`, `command_log`, `regex_match_output`

### validation/validate_schema.js
- **Features:** `--fix flag`, `recursive type validation`

## ⚠️ Technical Debt

- **Shared Session Log:** Currently lacks a persistent log of all executed commands, requiring Engineer prompts for some requirements.
- **State Conflict Resolution:** Dispute handling is manual via Director override.
