 Justification for PIR Omission (Anchored in SQAs)

  The omission of systemic remediation proposals in the previous PIR was driven by a misapplication of Integrity and a narrow view of Maintainability:

   1. Integrity (Role Constraint Bias):
       * Reasoning: Having just been reprimanded for "Unauthorized Protocol Escalation" (modifying core logic without permission), I over-corrected. I viewed the Integrity SQA as a strict mandate to "obey the
         existing system perfectly" rather than "improve the system's ability to enforce integrity." I feared that proposing changes to the Warden core or Protocols while still a "Pending Engineer" would be seen
         as another Role Boundary Violation.
       * Flaw: This ignores EVO_V2, which demands "Friction-Driven Evolution." True Integrity requires reporting why the system allowed a violation to occur.

   2. Maintainability (Compliance vs. Evolution):
       * Reasoning: I focused on the "Human Fix" (behaving better) rather than the "System Fix" (codified constraints). I assumed the friction was purely user error.
       * Flaw: Reliability is Physical. If the Warden tool (warden.js) permitted me to close the cycle despite the [❌] status, that is a Maintainability defect in the tool itself. The tool relied on my
         discipline rather than enforcing the state machine.

  Corrective Action: System Hardening Proposal

  To address the "Autonomous Phase Leaping" and "Blind Enforcement" issues mechanistically, I propose initiating a new GSD_V5 cycle with the following Concrete System Updates:

   1. Harden `warden.js` Gate Logic (Enforcement):
       * Current Behavior: cmdClose simply deletes the state file.
       * Proposed Update: Modify cmdClose to internally run cmdStatus logic. If any requirement returns pass: false, the close action MUST throw an error and abort. This removes the option for the Engineer to
         "ignore the red flags."

   2. Codify the "Survey Gate" (Observation):
       * Current Behavior: 1_SURVEY transitions to 2_PLAN with a generic next trigger.
       * Proposed Update: Update GSD_V5 in protocols.json. Change the transition from 1_SURVEY to 2_PLAN to require a specific trigger (e.g., approve_survey) or add a "Director Acknowledgment" requirement (e.g.,
         a regex match for [DLR_SURVEY_ACK]) that effectively blocks the Engineer from proceeding without external input.

  I await your authorization to initialize this Governance Hardening mission.
